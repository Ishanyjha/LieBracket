# LieBracket
Lie bracket vector. Lie algebra is the study of groups endowed or equipped with a lie bracket, a differential operator that is related to the metric connection. The lie bracket that satisfied the Jacobi identitiy, [X,[Y,Z]] + [Z, [Y,Z]] + [Y, [Z,X]] is an alternating bilinear map, meaning it takes two vectors or vector fields, and produces a third vector. This vector can be thought of as the seperation vector between the resultant points of transporting geometric data along one vector path (in a vector field) and then the other vector path, and vice versa.
Given two vector fields, u and v, and a starting point, we take the derivative of an object moving alongst u then v, then v then u. The seperation vector between the end-resultant points is the lie-bracket. It can also be thought of as the derivative of a vector or field along the flow generated by another.
